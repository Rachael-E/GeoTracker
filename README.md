# GeoTracker: CodeClan Project 2
A geological excursion finder and tracker for Android. 
For my Android App project week at CodeClan, I wanted to create an app which would allow an outdoor enthusiast to find a geological walk or excursion from a list of available sites, tap on the excursion to find more information, and to then save that walk to a favourites list to view later. 

The present version saved to this GitHub repo is a working prototype of a fully functioning app as described above. Future work will incorporate photographs for each walk, along with integrating a map into each walk. The app was built in Java using Android Studio, using Object Oriented Programming (following S.O.L.I.D. principles), and Shared Preferences to persist data across the application.
